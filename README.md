### Epilepsy
Epilepsy may occur as a result of a genetic disorder or an acquired brain injury, such as a trauma or stroke.
During a seizure, a person experiences abnormal behaviour, symptoms and sensations, sometimes including loss of consciousness. There are few symptoms between seizures.
Epilepsy is usually treated by medication and in some cases by surgery, devices or dietary changes.
### Seizure
A seizure is a sudden surge of electrical activity in the brain.
A seizure usually affects how a person appears or acts for a short time.
Many different things can occur during a seizure. Whatever the brain and body can do normally can also occur during a seizure.

## Detection 
If the prediction is 1 then the signal is epileptical otherwise the class is made 0 and signal is non epileptical.
